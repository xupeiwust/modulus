class Mesh:
    r"""A PyTorch-based, dimensionally-generic Mesh data structure.

    A ``Mesh`` is a discrete representation of an n-dimensional manifold embedded
    in m-dimensional Euclidean space (where n ≤ m). Field data can be associated
    with each point, with each cell, or globally with the mesh itself. This field
    data can be arbitrarily-dimensional (scalar fields, vector fields, or
    arbitrary-rank tensor fields) and semantically-rich (supporting string keys
    and nested data structures).

    **Simplices**

    The building block of a ``Mesh`` is a **simplex** (plural: **simplices**): a
    generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary
    dimensions. Consider these familiar examples of an n-dimensional simplex
    (an **n-simplex**):

    =========  ====================  =========================================
               Common Name           Description
    =========  ====================  =========================================
    0-simplex  Point                 A single vertex
    1-simplex  Line Segment / Edge   Connects 2 points; boundary: 2 0-simplices
    2-simplex  Triangle              Connects 3 points; boundary: 3 1-simplices
    3-simplex  Tetrahedron           Connects 4 points; boundary: 4 2-simplices
    =========  ====================  =========================================

    **Manifold Dimension**

    A ``Mesh`` is a collection of simplices that share vertices. Every simplex
    in a ``Mesh`` must have the same dimension; this shared dimension is called
    the **manifold dimension** (``n_manifold_dims``), representing the intrinsic
    dimensionality of each cell. A triangle has manifold dimension 2 regardless
    of whether it lives in 2D or 3D space.

    **Spatial Dimension and Codimension**

    The **spatial dimension** (``n_spatial_dims``) is the dimension of the
    embedding space where point coordinates live. A triangle mesh representing
    a 3D surface has ``n_spatial_dims=3`` but ``n_manifold_dims=2``.

    The difference, **codimension** = ``n_spatial_dims - n_manifold_dims``,
    determines whether unique normal vectors exist:

    - Codimension 1 (triangles in 3D, edges in 2D): unique unit normal (up to sign)
    - Codimension 0 (triangles in 2D, tets in 3D): no normal direction exists
    - Codimension > 1 (edges in 3D): infinitely many normal directions

    **Dimension-Parametrized Types**

    ``Mesh`` supports subscript notation ``Mesh[manifold_dims, spatial_dims]``
    for type annotations and runtime ``isinstance`` checks::

        def compute_normals(mesh: Mesh[2, 3]) -> torch.Tensor:
            ...  # accepts only triangle meshes in 3D

        isinstance(mesh, Mesh[2, 3])   # True for triangles in 3D
        isinstance(mesh, Mesh[1, ...]) # True for any edge mesh

    Use ``...`` (Ellipsis) to leave a dimension unconstrained. The notation
    also supports ``.boundary`` to derive the boundary type::

        Mesh[2, 3].boundary  # -> Mesh[1, 3]

    See :meth:`__class_getitem__` for the full specification, including
    symbolic dimension expressions like ``Mesh["n-1", "n"]``.

    **Core Data Structure**

    A mesh is defined by two tensors:

    - ``points``: Vertex coordinates with shape :math:`(N_p, D_s)` where
      :math:`N_p` is the number of points and :math:`D_s` is the spatial
      dimension. For 1000 vertices in 3D: shape ``(1000, 3)``.

    - ``cells``: Cell connectivity with shape :math:`(N_c, D_m + 1)` where
      :math:`N_c` is the number of cells and :math:`D_m` is the manifold
      dimension. Each row lists point indices defining one simplex. For 500
      triangles: shape ``(500, 3)`` since each triangle references 3 vertices.

    **Attaching Field Data**

    Tensor data of any shape can be attached at three levels:

    - ``point_data``: Per-vertex quantities (temperature, velocity, embeddings)
    - ``cell_data``: Per-cell quantities (pressure, stress, material ID)
    - ``global_data``: Mesh-level quantities (simulation time, Reynolds number)

    All data is stored in ``TensorDict`` containers that move together with the
    mesh geometry under ``.to(device)`` calls.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : torch.Tensor
        Vertex coordinates with shape :math:`(N_p, D_s)`. Must be floating-point.
    cells : torch.Tensor, optional
        Cell connectivity with shape :math:`(N_c, D_m + 1)`. Each row contains
        indices into ``points`` defining one simplex. Must be integer dtype.
        Defaults to an empty 0-simplex tensor for point-cloud meshes.
    point_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Per-vertex data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.
    cell_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Per-cell data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.
    global_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Mesh-level data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``points`` is not 2D, ``cells`` is not 2D, or manifold dimension
        exceeds spatial dimension.
    TypeError
        If ``cells`` has a floating-point dtype (indices must be integers).

    Examples
    --------
    Create a 2D triangular mesh (two triangles forming a unit square):

    >>> import torch
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh import Mesh
    >>> points = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0.0, 0.0],  # vertex 0: bottom-left
    ...     [1.0, 0.0],  # vertex 1: bottom-right
    ...     [1.0, 1.0],  # vertex 2: top-right
    ...     [0.0, 1.0],  # vertex 3: top-left
    ... ])
    >>> cells = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0, 1, 2],  # triangle 0: vertices 0-1-2
    ...     [0, 2, 3],  # triangle 1: vertices 0-2-3
    ... ])
    >>> mesh = Mesh(points=points, cells=cells)
    >>> mesh.n_points, mesh.n_cells, mesh.n_spatial_dims, mesh.n_manifold_dims
    (4, 2, 2, 2)

    Attach field data at vertices and cells:

    >>> mesh = Mesh(
    ...     points=points,
    ...     cells=cells,
    ...     point_data={"temperature": torch.tensor([300., 350., 340., 310.])},
    ...     cell_data={"pressure": torch.tensor([101.3, 99.8])},
    ... )

    Move mesh and all data to GPU:

    >>> mesh_gpu = mesh.to("cuda")  # doctest: +SKIP

    Create an undirected graph (1-simplices in 3D):

    >>> nodes = torch.randn(100, 3)  # 100 vertices in 3D
    >>> edges = torch.randint(0, 100, (200, 2))  # 200 edges
    >>> graph = Mesh(points=nodes, cells=edges)
    >>> graph.n_manifold_dims, graph.n_spatial_dims
    (1, 3)

    Create a point cloud (no connectivity):

    >>> points = torch.randn(50, 3)
    >>> cloud = Mesh(points=points)
    >>> cloud.n_points, cloud.n_cells, cloud.n_manifold_dims
    (50, 0, 0)

    Notes
    -----
    **Mixed Manifold Dimensions**

    To represent structures with multiple manifold dimensions (e.g., a
    tetrahedral volume mesh together with its triangular boundary surface),
    use separate ``Mesh`` objects for each dimension.

    **Non-Simplicial Elements**

    This class only supports simplicial cells. Non-simplicial elements must be
    subdivided before use:

    - **Quads** → split into 2 triangles each
    - **Hexahedra** → split into 5 or 6 tetrahedra each
    - **Polygons/polyhedra** → triangulate/tetrahedralize

    **Immutability**

    ``Mesh`` operations return new instances rather than modifying in place.
    For example, ``mesh.translate(offset)`` returns a new ``Mesh`` with
    translated points -- the original ``mesh`` is unchanged. This design
    enables safe caching of derived geometry (centroids, normals, curvature):
    cached values remain valid because the underlying ``points`` and ``cells``
    never change after construction.

    .. important::

       In-place modification of ``points`` or ``cells`` (e.g.,
       ``mesh.points[0] = ...``) is unsupported and will **silently
       invalidate** all cached properties. Always construct a new ``Mesh``
       instead.

    **Caching**

    Expensive geometric computations (centroids, areas, normals, curvature,
    adjacency) are cached in the ``_cache`` field -- a nested ``TensorDict``
    with ``"cell"``, ``"point"``, and ``"topology"`` sub-dicts. The cache is
    separate from ``point_data`` / ``cell_data``, so user data is never mixed
    with internal cached geometry.

    Caches are populated lazily on first access (e.g., the first call to
    ``mesh.cell_normals`` computes and caches the result; subsequent calls
    return the cached value). Because ``Mesh`` is effectively immutable (see
    above), cached values never go stale -- they remain valid for the
    lifetime of the ``Mesh`` instance.

    Geometric transforms (``translate``, ``rotate``, ``scale``, ``transform``)
    carry forward applicable cache entries to the new ``Mesh`` rather than
    discarding them. Topology caches are always preserved (transforms do not
    change connectivity). Geometric caches (areas, normals, centroids) are
    re-derived from the transform matrix where possible, avoiding
    recomputation from raw vertex data.

    Slicing operations (``slice_cells``, ``slice_points``) produce new
    ``Mesh`` instances with topology and all point-level caches cleared, and
    only the purely-local per-cell geometric caches (centroids, areas, normals)
    carried forward (sliced in lockstep). Non-local caches -- point normals,
    curvatures, and per-cell quantities derived from neighbours (e.g.
    ``gaussian_curvature``) -- are dropped so they recompute correctly for the
    new connectivity.

    Access cached values directly via nested keys::

        mesh._cache["cell", "centroids"]   # shape (n_cells, n_dims)
        mesh._cache["point", "normals"]    # shape (n_points, n_dims)

    Prefer using properties (``mesh.cell_centroids``, ``mesh.point_normals``)
    over direct ``_cache`` access.

        assume_convex : bool, default False
            If ``True``, skip the convexity test and ear-clip fallback and

        Each polygon ring must be a simple, approximately planar polygon with no

        For each point (vertex), computes a normal vector by averaging the normals
        of all adjacent cells. This provides a smooth approximation of the surface
        normal at each vertex.

        Four weighting schemes are available (following industry conventions from
        Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max):

        - **"area"**: Area-weighted averaging, where larger faces have more
          influence on the vertex normal. The normal at vertex v is computed as:
          ``point_normal_v = normalize(sum(cell_normal * cell_area))``.
          This reduces the influence of small sliver triangles.

        - **"unweighted"**: Simple averaging, where each adjacent face contributes
          equally regardless of size. The normal at vertex v is:
          ``point_normal_v = normalize(sum(cell_normal))``.
          This matches PyVista/VTK's ``compute_normals`` behavior.

        - **"angle"**: Angle-weighted averaging, where faces are weighted by the
          interior angle at the vertex. Faces with larger angles at the vertex
          have more influence. This often provides the most geometrically accurate
          normals for curved surfaces.

        - **"angle_area"** (default): Combined angle and area weighting, where each face's
          contribution is weighted by both its area and the angle at the vertex.
          This is the default in Maya and balances both geometric factors.

        Normal vectors are only well-defined for codimension-1 manifolds, where each
        cell has a unique normal direction. For higher codimensions, normals are
        ambiguous and this method will raise an error.

        Parameters
        ----------
        weighting : {"area", "unweighted", "angle", "angle_area"}
            Weighting scheme for averaging adjacent cell normals.

            - "unweighted": Equal weight for all adjacent cells (matches PyVista/VTK).
            - "angle": Weight by interior angle at the vertex.
            - "angle_area": Weight by both angle and area (Maya default).

            Tensor of shape (n_points, n_spatial_dims) containing unit normal vectors

        Uses a Dirichlet distribution to generate barycentric coordinates, which are
        then used to compute random points as weighted combinations of cell vertices.
        The concentration parameter alpha controls the distribution of samples within
        each cell (simplex).

        This is a convenience method that delegates to physicsnemo.mesh.sampling.sample_random_points_on_cells.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cell_indices : Sequence[int] or torch.Tensor or None, optional
            Indices of cells to sample from. Can be a Sequence or tensor.
            Allows repeated indices to sample multiple points from the same cell.
            If None, samples one point from each cell (equivalent to arange(n_cells)).
            Shape: (n_samples,) where n_samples is the number of points to sample.
        alpha : float, optional
            Concentration parameter for the Dirichlet distribution. Controls how
            samples are distributed within each cell:

            - alpha = 1.0: Uniform distribution over the simplex (default)
            - alpha > 1.0: Concentrates samples toward the center of each cell
            - alpha < 1.0: Concentrates samples toward vertices and edges

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            Random points on cells, shape (n_samples, n_spatial_dims). Each point lies
            within its corresponding cell. If cell_indices is None, n_samples = n_cells.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If alpha != 1.0 and torch.compile is being used.
            This is due to a PyTorch limitation with Gamma distributions under torch.compile.

        This is useful for torch.compile with dynamic=False, where fixed tensor shapes
        are required. By padding to powers of a base (default 1.5), we can reuse compiled
        kernels across a reasonable range of mesh sizes while minimizing memory overhead.

        This method computes the target sizes as floor(power^n) for the smallest n such that
        the result is >= the current size, then calls .pad() to perform the actual padding.

        Parameters
        ----------
        power : float
            Base for computing the next power. Must be > 1.
            Provides a good balance between memory efficiency and compile cache hits.
        data_padding_value : float
            Value to use for padding data fields. Defaults to NaN.

        Returns
        -------
        Mesh
            A new Mesh with padded points and cells arrays. The padding uses
            null elements that don't affect geometric computations.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If power <= 1.

        --------

        >>> padded = mesh.pad_to_next_power(power=1.5)  # doctest: +SKIP

        """Subdivide the mesh using iterative application of subdivision schemes.

        Subdivision refines the mesh by splitting each n-simplex into 2^n child
        simplices. Multiple subdivision schemes are supported, each with different
        geometric and smoothness properties.

        This method applies the chosen subdivision scheme iteratively for the
        specified number of levels. Each level independently subdivides the
        current mesh.

        Parameters
        ----------
        levels : int, optional
            Number of subdivision iterations to perform. Each level
            increases mesh resolution exponentially:

            - 0: No subdivision (returns original mesh)
            - 1: Each cell splits into 2^n children
            - 2: Each cell splits into 4^n children
            - k: Each cell splits into (2^k)^n children
        filter : {"linear", "butterfly", "loop"}, optional
            Subdivision scheme to use:

            - "linear": Simple midpoint subdivision (interpolating).
              New vertices at exact edge midpoints. Works for any dimension.
              Preserves original vertices.
            - "butterfly": Weighted stencil subdivision (interpolating).
              New vertices use weighted neighbor stencils for smoother results.
              Currently only supports 2D manifolds (triangular meshes).
              Preserves original vertices.
            - "loop": Valence-based subdivision (approximating).
              Both old and new vertices are repositioned for C² smoothness.
              Currently only supports 2D manifolds (triangular meshes).
              Original vertices move to new positions.

        Returns
        -------
        Mesh
            Subdivided mesh with refined geometry and connectivity.

            - Manifold and spatial dimensions are preserved
            - Point data is interpolated to new vertices
            - Cell data is propagated from parents to children
            - Global data is preserved unchanged

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If levels < 0 or if filter is not one of the supported schemes.
        NotImplementedError
            If butterfly/loop filter used with non-2D manifold.

        Notes
        -----
        Multi-level subdivision is achieved by iterative application.
        For levels=3, this is equivalent to calling subdivide(levels=1)
        three times in sequence. This is the standard approach for all
        subdivision schemes.

        r"""Clean and repair this mesh.

        Performs up to three cleaning operations in sequence:

        1. **Merge duplicate points** (``merge_points``): Finds points
           within ``tolerance`` L2 distance using BVH spatial queries and
           merges them into a single representative.  Point data values
           are averaged across merged groups.  Cost: :math:`O(N \log N)`
           where :math:`N` is the number of points.  This is the most expensive
           step - on meshes with millions of points it can take tens of
           seconds.
        2. **Remove duplicate cells** (``remove_duplicate_cells``): Sorts
           vertex indices within each cell and removes cells that share
           the same vertex set.  Cost: :math:`O(C \log C)` where :math:`C` is
           the number of cells.  Typically fast.
        3. **Remove unused points** (``remove_unused_points``): Drops
           points not referenced by any cell and compacts the point
           array.  Cost: :math:`O(N + C \cdot V)` where :math:`V` is vertices
           per cell.  Very fast (linear scatter + mask).

        This is useful after importing meshes from external sources (VTK,
        STL, CAD) that may have redundant geometry.  For programmatic mesh
        operations like ``slice_cells`` that don't create duplicates, you
        can disable the expensive steps and only keep
        ``remove_unused_points=True`` for a large speedup.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tolerance : float, optional
            Absolute L2 distance threshold for merging duplicate points.
        merge_points : bool, optional
            Whether to merge spatially-duplicate points (default True).
        remove_duplicate_cells : bool, optional
            Whether to remove cells with identical vertex sets (default True).
        remove_unused_points : bool, optional
            Whether to drop points not referenced by any cell (default True).
