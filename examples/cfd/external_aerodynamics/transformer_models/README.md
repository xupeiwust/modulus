# Transformer Models for External Aerodynamics on Irregular Meshes

This directory contains training and inference recipes for transformer-based surrogate models for CFD applications. This is a collection of transformer models including `Transolver` and `GeoTransolver`, both of which can be run on surface or volume data.

## Models Overview

### Transolver

`Transolver` is a high-performance surrogate model for CFD solvers. The Transolver model adapts the Attention mechanism, encouraging the learning of meaningful representations. In each PhysicsAttention layer, input points are projected onto state vectors through learnable transformations and weights. These transformations are then used to compute self-attention among all state vectors, and the same weights are reused to project states back to each input point.

By stacking multiple PhysicsAttention layers, the `Transolver` model learns to map from the functional input space to the output space with high fidelity. The PhysicsNeMo implementation closely follows the original Transolver architecture ([https://github.com/thuml/Transolver](https://github.com/thuml/Transolver)), but introduces modifications for improved numerical stability and compatibility with NVIDIA TransformerEngine.

### GeoTranSolver

GeoTransolver adapts the Transolver backbone by replacing standard attention with GALE (Geometry-Aware Latent Embeddings) attention, which unifies physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to geometry and global context embeddings. Inspired by Domino's multi-scale ball query formulations, GeoTransolver learns global geometry encodings and local latent encodings that capture neighborhoods at multiple radii, preserving fine-grained near-boundary behavior and far-field interactions. Crucially, geometry and global features are projected into physical state spaces and injected as context in every transformer block, ensuring persistent conditioning and alignment between evolving latent states and the underlying domain.

GALE directly targets core challenges in AI physics modeling. By structuring self-attention around physics-aware slices, GeoTransolver encourages interactions that reflect operator couplings (e.g., pressure–velocity or field–material). Multi-scale ball queries enforce locality where needed while maintaining access to global signals, balancing efficiency with nonlocal reasoning. Continuous geometry-context projection at depth mitigates representation drift and improves stability, while providing a natural interface for constraint-aware training and regularization. Together, these design choices enhance accuracy, robustness to geometric and regime shifts, and scalability on large, irregular discretizations.

## External Aerodynamics CFD Example: Overview

This directory contains the essential components for training and evaluating models tailored to external aerodynamics CFD problems. The training examples use the [DrivaerML dataset](https://caemldatasets.org/drivaerml/).

As a concrete example, we are training external aerodynamics surrogate models for automobiles. These models take as input a point cloud on the surface or surrounding the surface, iteratively processing it with transformer-based attention mechanisms to produce high-fidelity predictions.

## Requirements

These transformer models can use TransformerEngine from NVIDIA, as well as tensorstore (for IO), zarr, einops and a few other python packages. Install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt` as well as physicsnemo 25.11 or higher.

## Using Transformer Models for External Aerodynamics

1. Prepare the Dataset. These models use the same Zarr outputs as other models with DrivaerML. `PhysicsNeMo` has a related project to help with data processing, called [PhysicsNeMo-Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator). Using `PhysicsNeMo-Curator`, the data needed to train can be setup easily. Please refer to [these instructions on getting started](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-physicsnemo-curator) with `PhysicsNeMo-Curator`. For specifics of preparing the dataset for this example, see the [download](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator/blob/main/examples/external_aerodynamics/README.md#download-drivaerml-dataset) and [preprocessing](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator/blob/main/examples/external_aerodynamics/README.md) instructions from `physicsnemo-curator`. Users should apply the preprocessing steps locally to produce `zarr` output files.

2. Train your model. The model and training configuration is configured with `hydra`, and configurations are available for both surface and volume modes (e.g., `transolver_surface`, `transolver_volume`, `geotransolver_surface`, `geotransolver_volume`). Find configurations in `src/conf`, where you can control both network properties and training properties. See below for an overview and explanation of key parameters that may be of special interest.

3. Use the trained model to perform inference. This example contains inference examples for the validation set, already in Zarr format. The `.vtp` inference pipeline is being updated to accommodate these models.

The following sections contain further details on the training and inference recipe.

## Model Training

To train the model, first we compute normalization factors on the dataset to make the predictive quantities output in a well-defined range. The included script, `compute_normalizations.py`, will compute the normalization factors. Once run, it should save to an output file similar to "surface_fields_normalization.npz". This will get loaded during training. The normalization file location can be configured via `data.normalization_dir` in the training configuration (defaults to current directory).

> By default, the normalization sets the mean to 0.0 and std to 1.0 of all labels in the dataset, computing the mean across the train dataset. You could adapt this to a different normalization, however take care to update both the preprocessing as well as inference scripts. Min/Max is another popular strategy.

To configure your training run, use `hydra`. The config contains sections for the model, data, optimizer, and training settings. For details on the model parameters, see the API for `physicsnemo.models.transolver` and `physicsnemo.experimental.models.geotransolver`.

To fit the training into memory, you can apply on-the-fly downsampling to the data with `data.resolution=N`, where `N` is how many points per GPU to use. This dataloader will yield the full data examples in shapes of `[1, K, f]` where `K` is the resolution of the mesh, and `f` is the feature space (3 for points, normals, etc. 4 for surface fields). Downsampling happens in the preprocessing pipeline.

During training, the configuration uses a flat learning rate that decays every 100 epochs, and bfloat16 format by default. The scheduler and learning rate may be configured.

The Optimizer for this training is the `Muon` optimizer - available only in `pytorch>=2.9.0`. While not strictly required, we have found the `muon` optimizer performs substantially better on these architectures than standard `AdamW` and a oneCycle schedule.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)

To adapt a *pretrained* model to a new dataset cheaply — without retraining all weights — use the LoRA fine-tuning recipe in the [`src/finetune/`](src/finetune/) folder (`src/finetune/finetune.py` and `src/finetune/deploy.py`, with `src/conf/finetune_lora.yaml`). It freezes the base model and trains only small low-rank adapters, producing a compact adapter checkpoint that can be swapped at serve time or merged into the base. See [src/finetune/README.md](src/finetune/README.md) for the full workflow.

### Training Precision

These transformer architectures have support for NVIDIA's [TransformerEngine](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/index.html) built in. You can enable/disable the transformer engine path in the model with `model.use_te=[True | False]`. Available precisions for training with `transformer_engine` are `training.precision=["float32" | "float16" | "bfloat16" | "float8" ]`. In `float8` precision, the TransformerEngine Hybrid recipe is used for casting weights and inputs in the forward and backwards passes. For more details on `float8` precision, see the fp8 guide from [TransformerEngine](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/examples/fp8_primer.html). When using fp8, the training script will automatically pad and unpad the input and output, respectively, to use the fp8 hardware correctly.

> **Float8** precisions are only available on GPUs with fp8 tensorcore support, such as Hopper, Blackwell, Ada Lovelace, and others.

### Other Configuration Settings

Several other important configuration settings are available:

- `checkpoint_dir` sets the directory for saving model checkpoints (defaults to `output_dir` if not specified), allowing separation of checkpoints from other outputs.
- `compile` will use `torch.compile` for optimized performance. It is not compatible with `transformer_engine` (`model.use_te=True`). If TransformerEngine is not used, and half precision is, `torch.compile` is recommended for improved performance.
- `training.num_epochs` controls the total number of epochs used during training.
- `training.save_interval` will dictate how often the model weights and training tools are checkpointed.

> **Note** Like other parameters of the model, changing the value of `model.use_te` will make checkpoints incompatible.

The training script supports data-parallel training via PyTorch DDP. In a future update, we may enable domain parallelism via FSDP and ShardTensor.

The script can be launched on a single GPU with, for example,

```bash
python train.py --config-name transolver_surface
```

or, for multi-GPU training, use `torchrun` or other distributed job launch tools.

Example output for one epoch of the script, in an 8 GPU run, looks like:

## Dataset Inference

The validation dataset in Zarr format can be loaded, processed, and the L2 metrics summarized in `inference_on_zarr.py`. For surface data, this script will also compute the drag and lift coefficients and the R^2 correlation of the predictions.

To run inference on surface data, it's necessary to add a line to your launch command:

```
python src/inference_on_zarr.py --config-name transolver_surface run_id=/path/to/model/

```

The `data.return_mesh_features` flag can also be set in the config file. It is disabled for training but necessary for inference. The model path should be the folder containing your saved checkpoints.


To ensure correct calculation of drag and lift, and accurate overall metrics, the inference script will chunk a full-resolution training example into batches, and stitch the outputs together at the end. Output will appear as a table with all metrics for that mode, for example:

```
|   Batch |   Loss |   L2 Pressure |   L2 Shear X |   L2 Shear Y |   L2 Shear Z |   Predicted Drag Coefficient |   Pred Lift Coefficient |   True Drag Coefficient |   True Lift Coefficient |   Elapsed (s) |

  <!-- Alternatively, the model can be used
directly on `.vtp` or `.stl` files as shown in `inference_on_vtp.py`.  Note that the
script contains several parameters from the DrivaerML dataset as hardcoded variable
names: `CpMeanTrim`, `pMeanTrim`, `wallShearStressMeanTrim`, which are used to
compute the L2 metrics on the inference outputs. -->

<!-- In `inference_on_zarr.py`, the dataset examples are downsampled and preprocessed
exactly as in the training script.  In `inference_on_vtp.py`, however, the entire
mesh is processed.  To enable the mesh to fit into GPU memory, the mesh is chunked
into pieces that are then processed, and recombined to form the prediction on the
entire mesh.  The outputs are then saved to .vtp files for downstream analysis. -->

## Uncertainty Quantification

GeoTransolver supports two complementary UQ methods: a **Variational GP Head** for scalar-level (drag coefficient) uncertainty, and **Concrete Dropout / MC-Dropout** for per-point field uncertainty.  They can be used independently or together.

## Variational GP Head

### Overview

This recipe extends the GeoTransolver backbone with a **variational Gaussian Process (GP) head** that provides calibrated uncertainty estimates on a scalar quantity of interest — in this case, the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd).  The GP head enables two complementary uncertainty signals:

1. **Query-by-Committee disagreement** — The GeoTransolver predicts Cd by integrating its per-point field predictions; the GP head predicts Cd directly from the learned geometry embeddings.  When these two independent predictions disagree, the input is likely out-of-distribution (OOD).
2. **GP predictive variance** — The GP's posterior variance provides a data-driven measure of how far a new input lies from the training distribution in embedding space.  Unlike an ensemble of GeoTransolvers, the GP learns from a finite set of inducing points and its uncertainty naturally grows as inputs move away from the in-distribution region, providing a principled distance-aware uncertainty signal.

Together, these signals form a **joint UQ estimate** suitable for flagging OOD samples, which can be used to guide active learning sample selection and build trust in surrogate-model predictions.

> **Active learning** — An active-learning loop that uses the joint UQ signal to automatically select the most informative geometries for labelling is coming soon.

The GeoTransolver's `embedding_states` — the geometry/global context of shape `(B, H, S, D_c)` computed before the GALE cross-attention blocks — capture *what the geometry looks like* before any flow-field prediction.  Here `D_c` is the per-head context dimension from the GeoTransolver, while `D` (the final GP input dimension) is the reduced embedding size after attention pooling.  The pooling step reduces the variable-length `(B, H, S, D_c)` states to a fixed-size `(B, D)` embedding that is then fed to the GP head.

Key library modules used:

| Module | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `AttentionPooling` | `physicsnemo.nn` | Learnable attention-weighted pooling over variable-length point sequences |
| `VariationalGPHead` | `physicsnemo.experimental.uq` | Variational GP with Matérn-5/2 ARD kernel, float64 internals, optional DKL MLP |

### Training

Training is a two-phase process using a single script (`train_gp_combined.py`):

1. **Warmup (epochs 0–49):** Only the GeoTransolver backbone is trained with per-point field MSE loss.  The GP head is frozen during this phase because it needs meaningful geometric embeddings — training it on random, untrained backbone representations would produce a poorly conditioned variational posterior.
2. **Joint training (epochs 50+):** The GP head, embedding reduction, and consistency loss activate via a linear ramp.  Three losses are combined:
   - **Field MSE** — standard per-point loss on pressure + wall shear stress
   - **GP ELBO** — variational evidence lower bound on the drag prediction
   - **Consistency** — MSE between GP-predicted drag and field-integrated drag from the *same forward pass* (zero extra memory)

Launch training:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
    src/train_gp_combined.py \
    --config-name=geotransolver_surface_gp \
    ++run_id=geotransolver/surface/my_gp_experiment \
    ++data.train.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_F/train \
    ++data.val.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_F/val \
    ++data.resolution=51200 \
    ++data.geometry_sampling=51200 \
    ++data.return_mesh_features=true
```

The default config (`geotransolver_surface_gp.yaml`) includes tuned GP hyperparameter priors and embedding normalization settings.  The data-path overrides above point to the [DrivAerStar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16857) surface zarr files; `resolution` and `geometry_sampling` are lowered from the defaults (200k / 300k) to 51200 to fit in GPU memory.

### Evaluation and OOD Detection

After training, run the evaluation script to generate diagnostic plots:

```bash
python src/plot_gp_predictions.py \
    --config-name=geotransolver_surface_gp \
    ++run_id=geotransolver/surface/my_gp_experiment \
    ++data.train.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_F/train \
    ++data.val.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_F/val \
    ++data.resolution=51200 \
    ++data.geometry_sampling=51200 \
    ++data.return_mesh_features=true \
    ++data.test_notchback.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_N/val \
    ++data.test_estateback.data_path=/path/to/surface_files_zarr/class_E/val
```

This produces:
- **Scatter plots** — true vs predicted Cd for both the GP and GeoTransolver
- **Disagreement histograms** — distribution of |Cd_GP − Cd_GeoTransolver|
- **GP std dev histograms** — distribution of GP predictive standard deviation
- **Joint UQ scatter** — Cd predictions with combined uncertainty bands
- **KDE overlays** — kernel density estimates comparing ID vs OOD distributions

OOD test sets are auto-discovered from the config — any key matching `test_*` under `data:` is loaded automatically.  Add as many as you like via command-line overrides (`++data.test_myclass.data_path=...`).  The evaluation results are saved to `prediction_results.npz` for offline re-plotting without re-running inference.

#### Example: KDE of ID vs OOD signals

![KDE of disagreement and GP std dev for in-distribution vs OOD samples](../../../docs/img/kde_id_vs_ood.png)

The model was trained exclusively on **DrivAerStar Fastback** geometries (class F).  The figure above shows kernel density estimates of the two UQ signals evaluated on the in-distribution Fastback validation set and five OOD vehicle classes from different sources and body styles.

**Left — Disagreement:** The distribution of |Cd_GP − Cd_GeoTransolver| is tightly concentrated near zero for in-distribution Fastback samples (solid blue), indicating strong agreement between the two independent drag predictions.  OOD classes exhibit heavier tails and wider spread, meaning the GP and GeoTransolver diverge more when encountering unfamiliar geometries.  Notably, the disagreement signal correlates with geometric similarity to the training distribution: **Notchback** — the DrivAerStar body style most resembling Fastback — shows a relatively modest shift, while **Estateback** (a more distinct rear-end shape) and the **DrivaerML** / **ShiftSUV** classes (entirely different vehicle datasets) produce substantially larger disagreement.  This query-by-committee disagreement provides a strong, interpretable OOD detection signal.

**Right — GP Predictive Std Dev:** The GP's posterior standard deviation shows a subtle but consistent shift: in-distribution samples cluster in a narrow peak, while OOD samples spread to higher values.  The signal is weaker than disagreement alone, but the two are complementary — the joint UQ metric, for example `max(|disagreement|, 2 * GP_std)` combines both for more robust OOD flagging.

### Key Design Choices

| Choice | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Float64 GP internals** | Short lengthscales on L2-normalised embeddings make K_uu ill-conditioned in float32.  Float64 eliminates Cholesky failures at the source. |
| **L2-normalised embeddings** | Constrains pairwise distances to [0, 2], making GP lengthscale priors more interpretable and stable. |
| **Spectral norm on embedding layers** | Preserves distances in the embedding space (SNGP-style), preventing the encoder from collapsing different inputs to the same point. |
| **Matérn-5/2 ARD kernel** | Smooth, twice-differentiable, with per-dimension lengthscales that learn which embedding dimensions matter. |
| **Gamma priors on lengthscale & outputscale** | Prevents the GP from collapsing to trivial solutions (infinite lengthscale → constant predictions, zero outputscale → zero variance). |
| **`embedding_states` as GP input** | These capture geometry context *before* the flow-field GALE blocks, giving the GP access to what the shape looks like rather than the (already processed) flow prediction. |
| **Subsampled consistency loss** | Reuses the training forward pass — no extra full-mesh evaluation needed, making the consistency signal nearly free. |

### Customization Guide

The config file `src/conf/geotransolver_surface_gp.yaml` exposes all tunable parameters.  Common adjustments:

**Switching to an MLP baseline head:**

```bash
++head_type=mlp ++lambda_gp=1.0
```

The `DragMLP` head provides the same `forward_and_loss` / `predict` interface.  Downstream scripts work unchanged.

**Adjusting GP capacity:**

```yaml
embed_dim: 64         # Larger embedding → more expressive GP (default: 32)
n_inducing: 256       # More inducing points → better coverage (default: 128)
gp_mlp_hidden: [64, 32]  # Add DKL feature extractor before GP kernel
```

**Relaxing / tightening GP priors:**

```yaml
gp_lengthscale_range: [0.01, 2.0]   # Wider allowed range
gp_lengthscale_prior: [3.0, 6.0]    # Gamma(3, 6) → mean 0.5
gp_outputscale_prior: [2.0, 0.5]    # Gamma(2, 0.5) → mean 4.0
```

**Disabling consistency loss:**

```yaml
lambda_consistency: 0.0
```

**Enabling gradients through the GeoTransolver in the consistency path:**

```yaml
consistency_detach_transolver: false  # default; set true to save memory
```

### Dependencies

The GP head requires `gpytorch`.  Install it alongside PhysicsNeMo:

```bash
pip install nvidia-physicsnemo[uq-extras]
# or simply:
pip install gpytorch
```

## Concrete Dropout / MC-Dropout

GeoTransolver supports **model uncertainty quantification (UQ)** via **Concrete Dropout** ([Gal, Hron & Kendall, NeurIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07832)). Model UQ captures the uncertainty arising from the model itself -- given finite training data, there are many plausible sets of model weights, and model UQ estimates how much predictions vary across them. Instead of manually tuning per-layer dropout rates, Concrete Dropout learns the optimal dropout probability for each layer during training using a differentiable relaxation. At inference time, **MC-Dropout** (Monte Carlo Dropout) approximates Bayesian inference by running multiple stochastic forward passes, producing both a mean prediction and a per-point uncertainty estimate.

### Training with Concrete Dropout

Enable Concrete Dropout by setting two configuration options:

```bash
python train.py --config-name geotransolver_surface \
    model.concrete_dropout=true \
    training.lambda_reg=1e-4
```

- `model.concrete_dropout=true` replaces standard dropout layers with learnable `ConcreteDropout` layers throughout the model (GALE attention, context projectors, and FFN blocks).
- `training.lambda_reg` controls the weight of the dropout entropy regularization loss. This term encourages the learned dropout rates away from trivial values (0 or 1). A value of `0.0` (default) disables the regularization. Typical values are in the range `1e-5` to `1e-3`.

During training, the learned dropout rates for each layer are logged to TensorBoard under `dropout_rates/`.

### Inference with MC-Dropout

After training a model with Concrete Dropout, run MC-Dropout inference by specifying the number of stochastic forward passes:

```bash
python src/inference_on_zarr.py --config-name geotransolver_surface \
    run_id=/path/to/model/ \
    mc_dropout_samples=20
```

```bash
python src/inference_on_vtk.py --config-name geotransolver_surface \
    run_id=/path/to/model/ \
    mc_dropout_samples=20
```

- `mc_dropout_samples` sets the number of stochastic forward passes. Each pass uses the learned dropout masks to produce a different prediction. The mean across passes gives the final prediction, and the standard deviation provides a per-point uncertainty estimate.
- When `mc_dropout_samples=0` (the default), inference runs in standard deterministic mode with no dropout.
- The VTK inference script (`inference_on_vtk.py`) writes the mean and standard deviation fields to the output VTK files alongside the deterministic predictions.

> **Note:** MC-Dropout inference requires a model that was trained with `concrete_dropout=true`. If `mc_dropout_samples > 0` is set but no ConcreteDropout layers are found in the checkpoint, the script will log a warning and fall back to deterministic inference.
