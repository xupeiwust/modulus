Integrated aerodynamic force and moment coefficients from surface fields.

Surface models in this recipe predict, per surface cell, a pressure
coefficient :math:`C_p = (p - p_\\infty)/q_\\infty` and a skin-friction
coefficient vector :math:`C_f = \\tau_w / q_\\infty` (the pipeline's
``NonDimensionalizeByMetadata`` produces exactly these). The net
aerodynamic load on the body follows from integrating the surface
traction over the vehicle:

.. math::
    \\mathbf{t} = -C_p\\,\\mathbf{n} + \\mathbf{C}_f

where :math:`\\mathbf{n}` is the outward unit normal. The force and
moment coefficient vectors are

.. math::
    \\mathbf{C}_F = \\frac{1}{A_\\text{ref}} \\int_S \\mathbf{t}\\,dA,
    \\qquad
    \\mathbf{C}_M = \\frac{1}{A_\\text{ref} L_\\text{ref}}
        \\int_S (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_\\text{ref}) \\times \\mathbf{t}\\,dA .

The surface integral is evaluated with the mesh quadrature utility
:meth:`physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh.integrate` (cell-data / P0 rule:
:math:`\\int_S f\\,dA = \\sum_c f_c\\,A_c`).

The coefficient vectors are then projected onto an orthonormal
(drag, lift, side) triad built from the per-sample freestream direction
and a global "up" reference, yielding the conventional scalars:

- ``CD`` (drag, along the freestream), ``CL`` (lift), ``CS`` (side force).
- ``CMR`` / ``CMP`` / ``CMY`` (roll / pitch / yaw moment about the
  drag / side / lift axes).

Conventions and assumptions:

- **Outward normals.** ``Mesh.cell_normals`` are unique only up to
  orientation (they follow the cell winding). Forces assume a
  consistently *outward*-oriented surface; if a mesh is wound inward the
  pressure contribution flips sign. Because predicted and reference
  coefficients are integrated identically, the *error* between them is
  unaffected by a global orientation flip.
- **Reference area / length** are physical-unit quantities supplied by
  the caller. ``CD``/``CL``/``CM`` magnitudes are only physically
  meaningful when ``reference_area`` matches the dataset's convention;
  the predicted-vs-reference comparison is independent of it (a common
  positive scale factor cancels in the relative error).
- **Geometry scale.** Pipeline geometry is non-dimensionalized by
  ``L_ref`` (coordinates divided by ``L_ref``). Pass ``length_scale =
  L_ref`` to integrate on a physical-scale surface; areas and moment
  arms are translation-invariant, so the lost ``CenterMesh`` offset does
  not affect forces (and only shifts the moment reference for moments).
- **Full surface resolution.** The quadrature covers exactly the cells
  present on the ``vehicle`` mesh. If the pipeline subsampled the
  surface (``sampling_resolution`` below the mesh's cell count), the
  integral covers only the kept cells and every coefficient shrinks by
  roughly the kept-to-total area fraction -- for predicted and reference
  values alike, so the *comparison* stays meaningful but the magnitudes
  do not. ``ForceContext.coefficients``'s 1:1 points/cells contract
  check cannot detect this (a subsampled surface still satisfies it);
  ``infer.py`` warns when a vehicle's cell count sits at the
  ``sampling_resolution`` cap.
