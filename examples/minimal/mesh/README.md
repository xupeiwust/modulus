# PhysicsNeMo-Mesh Tutorials

This directory contains a series of progressive tutorials introducing
**PhysicsNeMo-Mesh** - NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated mesh processing library for
physics-AI applications.

## What is PhysicsNeMo-Mesh?

PhysicsNeMo-Mesh is a PyTorch-based library for working with simplicial meshes
(point clouds, curves, surfaces, volumes) in a unified, dimensionally-generic
framework. Key features include:

- **GPU-Accelerated**: All operations vectorized with PyTorch, run natively on CUDA
- **Dimensionally Generic**: Works with n-D manifolds embedded in m-D spaces
- **TensorDict Integration**: Structured data management with automatic device handling
- **Differentiable**: Seamless integration with PyTorch autograd
- **Flexible Data**: Arbitrary-rank tensor fields on points, cells, or globally

For the complete feature list, see the
[physicsnemo.mesh README](../../../physicsnemo/mesh/README.md).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended, not required)

## Installation

```bash
pip install nvidia-physicsnemo pyvista[all,trame] matplotlib jupyter
```

Or install from the repository:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mesh]"
```

## Running the Tutorials

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

```bash
cd examples/minimal/mesh
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any `tutorial_*.ipynb` file.

### Option 2: JupyterLab

```bash
cd examples/minimal/mesh
jupyter lab
```

### Option 3: VS Code / Cursor

Open the `.ipynb` files directly - they work with the built-in notebook support.

## Tutorial Contents

- Creating meshes from scratch
- Loading from PyVista and built-in primitives
- Attaching scalar, vector, and tensor data
- Visualization with `.draw()`
- GPU acceleration with `.to("cuda")`
- Autograd integration

### Tutorial 2: Operations and Transformations

**File**: `tutorial_2_operations.ipynb`

Learn mesh manipulation operations.

- Geometric transformations (translate, rotate, scale, transform)
- Dense point displacement from tensors or point-data fields
- Sparse control-point morphing with single or multiple controls
- Subdivision schemes (linear, Loop, Butterfly)
- Slicing (slice_cells, slice_points)
- Merging multiple meshes
- Boundary and facet extraction
- Data conversion (cell_data_to_point_data, point_data_to_cell_data)
- Topology checks (is_watertight, is_manifold)

### Tutorial 3: Discrete Calculus and Differential Geometry

**File**: `tutorial_3_calculus.ipynb`

Learn mathematical operations on meshes.

- Sparse adjacency encoding
- BVH construction and queries
- Point containment
- Random point sampling
- Data interpolation at query points

### Tutorial 5: Quality, Validation, and Repair

**File**: `tutorial_5_quality_repair.ipynb`

Learn mesh quality assessment and repair.

- Quality metrics (aspect ratio, angles, quality score)
- Mesh statistics
- Validation (detect errors)
- Repair operations (clean, remove duplicates, fix orientation)
- Manifold and watertight checking

### Tutorial 6: Integration with ML Workflows

**File**: `tutorial_6_ml_integration.ipynb`

Learn to use PhysicsNeMo-Mesh in production ML pipelines.

- Performance comparison with PyVista/VTK
- Batching with padding for torch.compile
- Feature extraction for ML models
- Boundary condition handling
- End-to-end CAE preprocessing workflow
- torch.compile compatibility

### Tutorial 7: Simulation Domains with DomainMesh

**File**: `tutorial_7_domain_mesh.ipynb`

Learn to represent full simulation domains with interior meshes and named boundaries.

- Building a DomainMesh from mesh primitives (cube volume + boundary surfaces)
- Inspecting domain properties and iterating over meshes
- Data augmentation via geometric transforms (quasi-equivariance)
- Validation and boundary watertightness checking
- Visualization of boundary patches by BC type
- Domain-wide operations (subdivide, clean)

### Tutorial 8: I/O - Interoperability and Serialization

**File**: `tutorial_8_io_interop.ipynb`

Learn to get meshes in and out of PhysicsNeMo-Mesh.

- The simplex-only data model (why importing usually means triangulating)
- Importing from PyVista with `from_pyvista` (automatic triangulation)
- Importing raw polygon soups with `Adjacency` + `triangulate` / `Mesh.from_polygons`
- Convex vs non-convex polygons: ear clipping for correct areas and forces
- Exporting to PyVista with `to_pyvista`
- Saving and loading the native, folder-based memmap format, including its
  on-disk layout (`.pmsh` for `Mesh`, `.pdmsh` for `DomainMesh`)

## Assets

The `assets/` directory contains pre-saved meshes for use in tutorials:

- `bunny.pt` - Stanford bunny mesh (coarse, use `.subdivide()` for detail)
