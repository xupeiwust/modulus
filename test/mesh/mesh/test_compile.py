"""Regression tests for `Mesh` under `torch.compile`.

These tests guard against the `tensordict` 0.12.x regression in PR
`pytorch/tensordict#1552`, where the @tensorclass init wrapper's bypass branch
silently skipped both field-default normalization (`pytorch/tensordict#1709`)
and ``__post_init__`` (`pytorch/tensordict#1708`) under ``torch.compile``.

The bug manifested as:

* ``Mesh(points=p, cells=c).cell_normals`` raising ``AttributeError`` inside a
  compiled function (the cached property could not find the ``_cache`` field
  that ``__post_init__`` was supposed to materialize from its ``None``
  default).
* Silent miscomputation of any property whose result depends on a field
  normalized in ``__post_init__``.

These tests construct a ``Mesh`` *inside* a ``torch.compile``-traced function
and assert that:

1. The compiled call does not raise.
2. The compiled output matches the eager output exactly.

If either upstream regression returns (e.g. via a future tensordict pin bump,
or a refactor of ``Mesh`` that loses the workaround), these tests fail loudly
instead of waiting for the notebook-level CI to break.
